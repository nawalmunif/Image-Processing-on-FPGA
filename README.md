# Imgae-Processing-on-FPGA



In order to implement the image processing algorithms and to process the
amount of data captured from sources such as medical instruments, intelligent
high speed real-time systems, etc. has become imperative. In this project, an
efficient FPGA-based design and implementation of image processing algorithm
will be presented using verilog hardware description language. The FPGA provides
the necessary hardware for image processing algorithms with flexibility to support
image processing by using different algorithms. Verilog coding is done in Vivado
2014.2.



See Instructions.txt file before running the project.
